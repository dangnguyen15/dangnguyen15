👋 Hi, I'm Nguyễn Hồng Đăng

I'm a 3rd-year Artificial Intelligence student at Hoa Sen University, passionate about Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision.
During my university years, I led multiple team projects (3–5 members each), covering topics from image similarity, face detection, and CNN classification to database systems and GUI apps.
I enjoy building practical AI applications and continuously improving my engineering skills.

Mình là sinh viên năm 3 ngành Trí tuệ Nhân tạo của trường Đại học Hoa Sen, yêu thích Machine Learning, Deep Learning và Computer Vision.
Trong thời gian học, mình đã lead nhiều dự án nhóm (3–5 thành viên) tập trung vào AI ứng dụng và các hệ thống phần mềm.
